XRPhone has built an integrated [Xumm](https://xumm.app) wallet [xApp](https://xumm.readme.io/docs/what-are-xapps).

This app enables for easily creating a regular account with XRPhone (non-merchant). The app setup process performs a verification of your mobile phone and then links the phone to your Xumm wallet. This is what enables the XRPhone phone system to send callers (customers making payment to merchants) push notifications containing the invoice details needed to pay a merchant invoice.

>[!NOTE]
><b>XRPhone xApp Welcome Wizard</b><br>
When you open the xApp for the first time you will need to go thru the setup wizard to create an XRPhone account.

Next we will be asked what type of XRPhone account we want to create.

>[!NOTE]
><b>Note about merchant accounts</b><br>
Currently merchants will be re-directed to the XRPhone Web Client to perform account setup. The xApp currently only supports the regular account sign-up process.

You have two options:

- **I'm someone who wants to pay invoices with XRP**

- **I'm a merchant who wants invoices paid with XRP**

As mentioned above in the blue box, the xApp currently only supports regular account setup (non-merchant). 

To continue with this document, tap on the option **I'm someone who wants to pay invoices with XRP**.

Next, we will enter the mobile phone number. 

> This should be the same mobile phone number that has the Xumm xApp open.

>[!NOTE]
><b>XRPhone Supported Regions</b><br>
Currently, we will be supporting North American region.

The XRPhone system will send you a SMS text message. When you have received the text message enter the verification code / paste the code into the **Enter SMS Code** verification screen.

  <div class="caption">After you have entered the code, wait a few moments for the system to confirm you entered the correct code.</div>
</center>

After your account has been verified you should be re-directed to the main XRPhone xApp Dashboard.

This screen provides a simple button **1 (844) 739-0111** to trigger a call to the main XRPhone toll-free voice response system. In addition you will be able to see your **Linked Phone** number, **XRP Address**, and the **XRPL Network** that your XRPhone account is configured.

The xApp also contains two other screens at the bottom of the app. You will see a section called **Payments** (located in the bottom middle of the screen).

This screen provides three separate columns:

- **Date/Time** 
The date & time when the transaction was recorded on the XRP Ledger.

- **Transaction ID**
The identifier for the payment transaction recorded on the XRP Ledger.

- **Details** 
Tap the **View** button to open the completed transaction directly within the Xumm wallet. Since the XRPhone app is a xApp, we are able to directly interface with different parts of the Xumm wallet to provide a smooth user experience.

Finally, we can move on to the last screen **Settings** (located in the bottom right corner) of the xApp.

Settings provides us with the following options:

**Phone Number**
Tap the **Change linked phone number** to use a different phone number.

**Account**
Tap the **Delete XRPhone account** to fully delete your account.
