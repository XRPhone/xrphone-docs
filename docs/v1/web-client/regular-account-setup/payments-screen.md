When you first login to your XRPhone account you will see the main dashboard payments screen also known as the **Invoices** section.

This screen will display all of the invoice payments you have made to XRPhone Merchants. If you would like to view the actual XRPL payment transaction you can tap the XRPL column button. It will open the transaction details directly on the XRPL explorer site.

<div class="caption">Notice the amount column. All of the amounts show in red color. This means that the amount was debited from your XRP wallet since you made a payment for a merchant invoice.</div>
