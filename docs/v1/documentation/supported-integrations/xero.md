When a merchant is creating a new XRPhone Merchant account they can select Xero from the list of supported app integrations. 

XRPhone will open a small Xero authorization window. After the merchant has entered their Xero credentials into the Xero login screen, XRPhone will receive the necessary access to sync with the invoice accounting data.

Merchants can always disconnect/reconnect the Xero integration from directly within the XRPhone Web Client merchant settings screen.

XRPhone creates a special XRP chart of account directly inside Xero when you connect your XRPhone Merchant account to Xero.
