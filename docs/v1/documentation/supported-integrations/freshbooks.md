When a merchant is creating a new XRPhone Merchant account they can select Freshbooks from the list of supported app integrations. 

XRPhone will open a small Freshbooks authorization window. After the merchant has entered their Freshbooks credentials into the Freshbooks login screen, XRPhone will receive the necessary access to sync with the invoice accounting data.

Merchants can always disconnect/reconnect the Freshbooks integration from directly within the XRPhone Web Client merchant settings screen.

Inside Freshbooks when we tap directly on a specific invoice we can view at the bottom all payments.

In addition, we can directly access the Freshbooks Payments screen to view all of the payments made on invoices. Here we can see some of the payments made via XRP.
