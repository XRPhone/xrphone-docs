When a merchant is creating a new XRPhone Merchant account they can select Quickbooks Online from the list of supported app integrations. 

XRPhone will open a small Quickbooks Online authorization window. After the merchant has entered their Quickbooks Online credentials into the Quickbooks Online login screen, XRPhone will receive the necessary access to sync with the invoice accounting data.

Merchants can always disconnect/reconnect the Quickbooks Online integration from directly within the XRPhone Web Client merchant settings screen.

To view XRP payments made on a specific Quickbooks Online invoice we can tap the invoice from directly within the Quickbooks Online web interface.
