When you first login to your XRPhone Merchant account you will see the main dashboard payments screen also known as the **Invoices** section.

This screen will display all of the invoice payments you have received from your customers. If you would like to view the actual XRPL payment transaction you can tap the XRPL column button. It will open the transaction details directly on the XRPL explorer site.
